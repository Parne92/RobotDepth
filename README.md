# RobotDepth

Project 3 

Project 3 entails the tangoBot staying a set distance 
from a tracked object. 

Project 4 

The TangoBot will use edge detection and center of 
gravity to follow a line on the floor. It is important to 
have a clean image for this one. 

Final Project 

The Robot will spin in a circle, looking for a traffic cone 
Upon locating the cone, it will drive towards the cone, and begin 
looking for a face. Present the robot a color. The robot will now 
seek out that color other places it can see from the current location
